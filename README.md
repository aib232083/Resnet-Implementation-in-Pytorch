# Resnet-implimentation-in-Pytorch

This repo contains the code of impimentation of ResNet architecture in Pytorch from scratch. I experimented with different types of normalization techniques to see the performance of the model on image classification having 25 classes.

I also implimented the Grade cam method to visualize the pixels in image where there is the maximum change in the gradient, which helps us understand the workings of model as model is taking which features into the account while classifying a particular class.
